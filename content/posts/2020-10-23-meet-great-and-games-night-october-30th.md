Hello SSY Members! Please join us for our first (virtual) event of the year!

The first part of the event will be focused on introducing and officially welcoming YOU to the club. Our execs will introduce themselves, and then onto the games!

For the second half of the event, we will be splitting up in groups. Everyone will be paired up with one of our execs. Once everyone is in, the game starts. Be careful, our execs are VERY competitive!

All is welcome. You, as an SSY member (or not - YET), are encouraged to come, but feel free to invite your friends as well. There are no admission fees or membership fees. What does this mean for you? â€” FREE event to make long-lasting friendships.
